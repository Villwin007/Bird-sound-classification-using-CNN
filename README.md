# Bird Species Identification Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatic bird species classification using audio recordings. By converting bird sounds into spectrograms and applying deep learning techniques, we've developed a robust model for ecological monitoring and wildlife conservation.

## Key Features
- Advanced bird species identification using deep learning
- Spectrogram-based audio classification
- Data augmentation for improved model robustness
- Automated ecological monitoring solution

## Project Objectives
- Develop a CNN-based classification model using TensorFlow
- Improve bird species identification accuracy in noisy conditions
- Create an automated solution for ecological monitoring
- Support conservation activities through technology

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- Resampling audio files to standard frequency (16 kHz)
- Converting audio to spectrograms using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
- Applying noise reduction and normalization techniques
- Implementing data augmentation (time stretching, pitch shifting)

### Model Architecture
- 3 Convolutional layers (32, 64, 128 filters)
- Max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- 2 Fully connected layers
